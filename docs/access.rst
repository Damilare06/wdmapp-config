Applying for Access
*******************************************************************

Overview
============

The Whole Device Model Application (WDMApp) uses access controlled versions of
XGC, GENE, and supporting tools.  Before installing these packages users must
first apply for access.  Specific instructions for each package, and WDMApp are
given below.

XGC
===========================
Visit https://www.pppl.gov/organization/technology-transfer/software-access-request for instructions.  Be sure to
reference the WDMApp ECP project and list `XGC-Develop` as the needed software.

GENE
==================
Visit http://genecode.org/ then click the 'Get GENE' link at that top and fill
out the form.

WDMAPP
==================
Once you have submitted applications to the above, and access has been granted, please send
your GitHub and GENE GitLab usernames to `kai dot germaschewski at unh dot edu` and
`smithc11 at rpi dot edu` so we can verify your access to XGC and GENE and give you membership to the 
WDMApp GitHub Organization.
