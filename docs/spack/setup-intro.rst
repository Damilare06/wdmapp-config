Spack is a generic package manager for HPC. We rely on it in the following to install
WDMapp and its components. Setting up Spack is a one-time process on a given machine
-- if you already have a working Spack install, you should be able to use it.
However, in practice there are plenty of ways that things can wrong, so we provide
tested Spack setups for a selection of machines. Following our instructions makes sure,
that, e.g., our codes are built with compatible compilers.
