Machine-Specific Setup
======================

Ubuntu 18.04
---------------------

On Ubuntu 18.04, nothing special needs to be done, though installation
can be sped up by adding a ``packages.yaml`` that teaches it about
system-installed software so that it doesn't have to build everything
from scratch.
